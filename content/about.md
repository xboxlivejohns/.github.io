Meet John

## Your trusted local detailer

I'm John, the face behind Polished & Pristine Mobile. After more than 20 years perfecting vehicles for leading dealerships and prestige garages, I launched my own detailing studio in 2019 to bring a more personal, transparent service to fellow North East drivers.

Since then, I've earned over 200 five-star reviews—without a single rating below five stars—by treating every car as if it were my own and communicating clearly from the first call to the final handover. I'm born-and-bred local, still living in Darlington, and proud to support the community that supports me.
