## Colour Usage Guide — Blue & Gold Hybrid Theme

### 1. Base Colours
- **Dark background (charcoal/navy):** Use for hero sections, galleries, and testimonials to deliver the premium feel.
- **Light background (white/light grey):** Use for pricing, packages, FAQs, and form sections to maximise readability.

### 2. Accent Colours
- **Gold (primary accent):**
  - Primary buttons such as “Book now” or “Get a quote”.
  - Price highlights (for example, “from £200”).
  - Section dividers or icons — apply sparingly for emphasis.
- **Blue (secondary accent):**
  - Outline/secondary buttons (e.g. “Learn more”, “WhatsApp”).
  - Links that sit on light sections.
  - Section headers or supporting text elements.

### 3. Text
- Use dark/charcoal text on light backgrounds.
- Use white or light grey text on dark backgrounds.
- Use muted grey text for secondary information (notes, disclaimers).

### 4. Cards & Panels
- **Light cards:** White background with a subtle shadow and border for pricing tables and package boxes.
- **Dark cards:** Reserve for use within dark sections (e.g. gallery captions, testimonials).

### 5. Buttons
- **Primary button:** Gold background with dark text so it stands out on both light and dark sections.
- **Secondary button:** Transparent background with a blue border and blue text.
- **Hover states:** Slightly darken the base colour on hover.

### 6. Usage Ratios
- Dark sections should account for roughly 30% of a page (heroes, galleries).
- Light sections should make up roughly 70% of a page (services, pricing, FAQs).
- Gold accents should stay within 5–10% usage for maximum impact.
- Blue accents should cover around 10–15% to guide the eye without overpowering.

### 7. Visual Flow
- Start key pages with a dark hero to deliver a premium first impression.
- Transition quickly into light body sections for easy reading.
- Optionally close on a dark gallery or testimonial band so photography pops.
