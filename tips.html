  // FAQ data (30 items) - same content we agreed earlier
  const faqData = [
    {q: "What’s the real difference between a car wash, a valet, and a detail?", a: "A basic car wash cleans surfaces. A valet uses safe methods for a thorough clean. Detailing restores, protects and perfects with decontamination and polish."},
    {q: "My car's interior has seen better days thanks to kids and a dog! What can you do?", a: "We use steam sanitisation, hot water extraction and specialist stain removal to reset interiors. Interior Deep Clean from £80."},
    {q: "Is a machine polish the same as T-cutting or removing scratches?", a: "T-cut is abrasive and hand-applied; machine polishing uses controlled tools and pads for safer defect removal."},
    {q: "I've heard about fallout and decontamination. Is that necessary?", a: "Yes — chemical decontamination removes bonded iron and tar so coatings and waxes bond properly."},
    {q: "What is a ceramic coating, and is it better than waxing?", a: "Ceramic coatings form a semi-permanent bond providing better durability, chemical resistance and hydrophobic properties than wax."},
    {q: "How often should I have my car polished or corrected?", a: "New cars: 12–18 months if coated. Older cars: 6–12 months depending on exposure."},
    {q: "Is ceramic coating worth it on my daily driver?", a: "Yes — it reduces maintenance and protects against UV, bird droppings and chemicals."},
    {q: "Can I put a PPF on my car myself?", a: "DIY is risky. Professional installation is recommended for seamless, bubble-free results."},
    {q: "How do I safely remove contaminants like iron fallout or tar?", a: "Use professional chemical decontamination and clay barring rather than harsh abrasives."},
    {q: "Do tinted windows need special care during detailing?", a: "Yes. Use pH-neutral cleaners and avoid abrasive tools near tint."},
    {q: "Can I wash my car in the winter without damaging it?", a: "Yes, but avoid freezing conditions. Use warm water, dry quickly and avoid harsh winter chemical cleaners."},
    {q: "What’s the best way to maintain leather and interior surfaces?", a: "Condition leather every 3–6 months, use pH-neutral cleaners and steam sanitize for deep hygiene."},
    {q: "How can I make my car stand out at shows or meets?", a: "Prioritise paint enhancement, engine bay detailing, protected wheels and a spotless interior."},
    {q: "How do I prevent swirl marks when washing my car?", a: "Two-bucket method, grit catchers, microfiber mitts and proper drying technique."},
    {q: "How do I maintain gloss on dark-colored cars?", a: "Regular decontamination, polishing and coatings — avoid brush washes."},
    {q: "Can I apply wax over ceramic coating?", a: "Yes, but it's not necessary; maintenance sprays are usually better for coated cars."},
    {q: "How often should I decontaminate my paint?", a: "Every 6–12 months depending on environment and exposure."},
    {q: "Why is paint correction important before coating?", a: "Coatings bond to the surface — correct defects first so finish is perfect and durable."},
    {q: "Are matte finishes treated differently?", a: "Yes — matte requires specific products to avoid creating shine."},
    {q: "Can I leave my car outside after ceramic coating?", a: "Yes, but remove bird droppings and harsh contaminants quickly to protect the coating."},
    {q: "Is machine polishing safe on thin paint?", a: "Yes when professionals use paint depth gauges and the right pads/polishes."},
    {q: "How do I care for carbon fiber or alloy parts?", a: "Use mild cleaners, microfiber cloths, and safe coatings for composites."},
    {q: "How do I remove water spots safely?", a: "Use pH-neutral water spot removers or professional deionised treatments."},
    {q: "What is hydrophobic treatment and why is it good?", a: "A hydrophobic treatment repels water, reduces dirt adhesion and makes washing easier."},
    {q: "Can detailing help resale value?", a: "Yes — a protected, clean car shows it’s been cared for and commands higher buyer confidence."},
    {q: "How do I maintain matte black interiors?", a: "Use non-gloss cleaners, avoid silicone products and steam clean fabrics."},
    {q: "How do I keep wheels clean and protected?", a: "Use dedicated wheel cleaners, brushes and wheel sealants regularly."},
    {q: "Do pets affect detailing frequency?", a: "Yes — pet owners need more frequent interior deep cleans for hair, scratches and odours."},
    {q: "How do I protect convertible tops?", a: "Use fabric-specific cleaners and UV-safe protectants; avoid pressure washing the top."},
    {q: "Are eco-friendly car shampoos as effective?", a: "Yes — modern eco shampoos clean well while being gentler on the environment."}
