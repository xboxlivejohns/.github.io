                <!-- Question 1 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <button class="faq-question">
                        <span>What’s the real difference between a car wash, a valet, and a detail?</span>
                        <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
                    </button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>This is one of the most common questions we get, and the difference is significant.</p>
                        <p>A <strong>basic car wash</strong> (like an automated one) is simply about surface-level cleaning. It often uses harsh brushes and chemicals that can strip existing protection and even inflict fine scratches, or "swirl marks," on your paintwork.</p>
                        <p>A <strong>professional valet</strong> is about thoroughness and using the correct, safe techniques. Our <strong>Bronze Package</strong> is a perfect example of a high-quality maintenance valet. We use a two-bucket safe wash method, clean the wheels and door shuts properly, and provide a basic level of protection.</p>
                        <p><strong>Detailing</strong> goes much deeper. Our <strong>Silver and Gold Packages</strong> are where we move into detailing. The key difference is decontamination and restoration. With our Silver Package, we perform a full chemical decontamination to remove embedded iron and tar that washing can't. We also deep clean and sanitize the interior with professional-grade steam and hot water extraction for a hygienic, as-new finish. Our Gold Package takes this even further with machine polishing to restore gloss and remove light paint defects.</p>
                        <p>In short, valeting cleans, while detailing restores, protects, and perfects.</p>

                <!-- Question 2 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <button class="faq-question">
                        <span>My car's interior has seen better days thanks to kids and a dog! What can you do?</span>
                        <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
                    </button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>You've come to the right place! This is a situation where our specialist equipment truly shines and makes a world of difference. For a car that needs a complete interior reset, we would strongly recommend our <strong>Silver Package</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Here’s why it’s the perfect solution:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>It’s more than a wipe-down:</strong> We don’t just clean the surfaces you can see. We use professional-grade steam to sanitize all hard surfaces, including plastics, dashboards, and tricky areas like air vents. This process kills 99.9% of germs and bacteria, which is a major benefit for families.</li>
                            <li><strong>We remove deep-seated dirt:</strong> For seats, carpets, and mats, we use a hot water shampoo and extraction process. This machine flushes out the embedded dirt, spills, and odours that a vacuum simply can't reach, leaving the fabric genuinely clean and fresh.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>If the exterior of your car is in good shape and you only need this intensive interior work, our standalone <strong>Interior Deep Clean</strong> service (starting from £80) is the ideal choice.</p>

                <!-- Question 3 -->
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <button class="faq-question">
                        <span>Is a machine polish the same as "T-cutting" or removing scratches?</span>
                        <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
                    </button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>This is an important distinction. While both aim to improve the paint's appearance, they are worlds apart in terms of process and results.</p>
                        <p><strong>"T-cut"</strong> is a brand of abrasive compound often applied by hand. It can be very aggressive and, if used incorrectly, can leave the paint looking hazy or instill its own fine scratches.</p>
                        <p><strong>Professional machine polishing</strong>, as included in our <strong>Gold Package</strong>, is a highly skilled process. We use a professional machine polisher with specific pads and polishes to carefully level the top layer of your car's clear coat. This process removes a microscopic layer, which is how we safely remove light swirl marks and defects, dramatically enhancing gloss and clarity. For deeper scratches, we offer <strong>Multi-Stage Paint Correction</strong>, a more intensive process that can achieve 85-95%+ defect removal.</p>
                        <p>Crucially, as professionals, we may use a paint depth gauge to measure the paint thickness before starting any correction work, ensuring the process is performed safely.</p>

                <!-- Question 4 -->
                 <div class="faq-item">
                    <button class="faq-question">
                        <span>I've heard about "fallout" and "decontamination." Is that really necessary?</span>
                        <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
                    </button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Absolutely. Chemical decontamination is a cornerstone of a proper detail and a key feature of our <strong>Silver and Gold Packages</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Your car is constantly bombarded with contaminants that bond to the paint and cannot be removed by washing alone. The two main types are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Iron Fallout:</strong> These are tiny metal particles from brake dust and industrial sources. They embed in your paint and can cause rust spots. Our fallout removers contain a chemical that reacts with these particles, turning purple and safely dissolving them so they can be rinsed away.</li>
                            <li><strong>Tar & Glue:</strong> These are sticky deposits from the road surface that cling to the lower parts of your car.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Without removing these bonded contaminants, the paint surface will never be truly clean, and any wax, sealant, or coating you apply won't bond properly or last as long. It’s a critical step for achieving a smooth, durable finish.</p>

                <!-- Question 5 -->
                 <div class="faq-item">
                    <button class="faq-question">
                        <span>What is a ceramic coating, and is it better than waxing?</span>
                        <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
                    </button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>A ceramic coating is the ultimate in paint protection, offering a significant upgrade over traditional waxes.</p>
                        <p>A <strong>wax</strong>, like the durable hand wax we apply in our <strong>Silver Package</strong>, is an organic or synthetic layer that sits on top of the paint. It provides great gloss and protection, typically for up to 6 months.</p>
                        <p>A <strong>ceramic coating</strong> (containing SiO2, or silica dioxide) is a liquid polymer that forms a semi-permanent, chemical bond with your car's paint. This creates a hard, glassy layer of protection.</p>
                        <p>The key benefits are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Durability:</strong> Our coatings last for years, not months. We offer 2-Year
